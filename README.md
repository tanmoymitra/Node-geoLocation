# Node.js + Express + React View Engine
This is simple example how to get geo location. 
I have used `express-react-views` npm package in express view engine to display result. 

# Store.js Implementation 
Check data is available on the local storage then query to the service and save them in local storage. If data is available on local storage then it will fetch data from Local Storage.
